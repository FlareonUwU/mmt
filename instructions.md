## By [Nxybi](https://github.com/WhenDawnEnds) (macOS version for shits and giggles by [BenjiThatFoxGuy](https://github.com/ddomino007))
--If you get an error saying "ModuleNotFound" (bottom line), please run setup.bat or setup-macos.sh if you're on macOS.--
<details>
---make sure you're in the folder where you extracted the zip of the repo.---
</details>

## --Important--
Please make sure that:
 You are on Windows or Macos, as there's no Linux version (yet?)
 That you have a forge profile installed on your launcher 
 You have Python 3 or above installed
 That config.json is configured correctly (ONLY CHANGE IF YOUR MINECRAFT IS NOT INSTALLED IN THE DEFAULT LOCATION, also the config doesn't affect the macOS version)
 <details>
 macOS version targets the Mojang launcher at ```~/Library/Application Support/minecraft```
 </details>
 That you do not touch any code in the files outside of the mods folder (not incluiding config.json) unless you know what you are doing


--Instructions--
1. Download some mods, I suggest a website like Planet Minecraft, or Curse
2. Move the mod files into the 'mods' folder
3. When you got every mod you want, then continue
4. Now just run the file called 'run.bat'/'run-macos.sh' 
<details>
or just navigate into the folder you extracted the repo zip and run ```python main.py``` in your favorite CLI (if you're on macOS, run ```python3 main-macos.py``` instead.)
</details>
5. Now hey presto! You're done! I might make a removal tool soon, so stay tuned :)
