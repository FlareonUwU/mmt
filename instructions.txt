--Minecraft Mod Transfer Tool--
By Nxybi 

--If you get an error saying "ModuleNotFound" (bottom line), please run setup.bat--

--Important--
Please make sure that:
 You are on Windows, as there is no Mac/Linux version
 That you have a forge profile installed on your launcher 
 You have Python 3 or above installed
 That config.json is configured correctly (ONLY CHANGE IF YOUR MINECRAFT IS NOT INSTALLED IN THE DEFAULT LOCATION)
 That you do not touch any code in the files outside of the mods folder (not incluiding config.json) unless you know what you are doing


--Instructions--
1. Download some mods, I suggest a website like Planet Minecraft, or Curse
2. Move the mod files into the 'mods' folder
3. When you got every mod you want, then continue
4. Now just run the file called 'run.bat'
5. Now hey presto! You're done! I might make a removal tool soon, so stay tuned :)
